====== Procedural ======
Created Saturday 19 April 2025

We want to use the new item generation, but it should be separate from the main progression. So my idea is for an area called the **Iron Labyrinth**.

This will be a repeatable dungeon that has the player collecting keys to progress. Ideally, it will be procedural, which will require engine support. How will map generation work?:
* Master maps with defined regions for rooms and/or corridors
* Corridors contain locked doors. Rooms contain keys (either by enemy drop or chest)
* Generated maps are saved to disk in the standard map format. Will need a way to invalidate this "cache" and regenerate the map (i.e. after finishing the dungeon)
