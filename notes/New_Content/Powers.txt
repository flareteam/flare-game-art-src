====== Powers ======
Created Saturday 19 April 2025

===== Warrior =====
* **Vampirism/Vampiric Strike**: Either a buff that grants HP steal, or HP steal on a single attack
* **Rupture**: Kind of like the magician's Freeze spell, except physical damage. Applies debuff to target that lowers avoidance/poise

===== Ranger =====
* **Charged Shot**: Use Shield Bash-like state hold to pause animation before triggering the second stage. High knockback, and maybe high crit?
* **Poison Shot**: Causes a poison cloud to spawn when connecting with a target/wall. Cloud animation is fairly long, can hit multiple enemies. Poison damage-over-time. Test interaction with bleeding damage-over-time

===== Magician =====
* **Summon Zombie**: Weaker version of the scroll. Maybe levels determine summon count?
* **Shadow Orb**: Dark damage projectile. Applies a status to target that **increases** Dark resist, but decreases resist for all other damage types (weighted more towards non-elemental damage)
